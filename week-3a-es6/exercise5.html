<!-- Make a new html page, make a script tag
Make a variable called shirt_cost and set it to 3.5 
Make another variable called tax_rate and set it to .1
Prompt the user: How many shirts do you want to buy? And store it into a variable named quant_shirts_to_buy
Then make a variable called cost_pre_tax and set it quant_shirts_to_buy * shirt_cost
Then make a variable called cost_post_tax and set it to cost_pre_tax + cost_pre_tax*tax_rate
Then alert cost_post_tax and say you owe this much:  -->
