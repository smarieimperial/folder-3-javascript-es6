<!-- ### File
* *None*
### Instructions
* Create a website (from scratch) that asks users if they eat potatoes. Use a confirm (not a prompt)
* If they respond with true, write the following to the page: "Here’s a bunch of fries!"
* If they respond with false, write the following to the page: "Here’s a Tofu Stir-Fry!"
* **BONUS:** Ask what the user’s birth year is. If they are under 21, alert the following: "No Sake for you!"
* **HINT:** You will need to use `document.write()` -->

<script type="text/javascript">

let x = "here's a bunch of fries!";
let y = "here's a tofu stir fry!";
	
		let potatoe = confirm('do you eat potatoes?');

		if (potatoe == true) {
			document.write(x);
		} else if (potatoe == false) {
			document.write(y);
        }
